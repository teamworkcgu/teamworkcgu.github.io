    <p><strong>Transmission electron microscope (TEM) of NMBs and PE-co-PAAB41@Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub></strong>
       Individual NMBs with clean boundaries could be observed by TEM, as shown in <b>Figure 1.1</b>, and the NMBs were close to each other forming a cluster with small gaps between each other. The average diameter of NMBs was 9.8 nm by comparing each nanoparticle with the scale bar. Individual NMBs of PE-co-PAAB41@Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> couldn’t be recognized, as shown in <b>Figure 1.2</b>, since NMBs were tightly wrapped by a film of PE-co-PAAB41. The results were matched to our expectation which the form of NMBs should change after being coated with PE-co-PAAB41, indicating that coating of PE-co-PAAB41 onto NMBs was successful.

    <p>The chemical formula of NMBs was Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and iron could lead to a peak of FTIR spectrum at about 580 cm<sup>-1. </sup>There was a strong peak at 588 cm<sup>-1</sup>, as shown in <b>Figure 3</b>, indicating that the synthesis of NMBs was successful. The peaks at 3422 and 1688 cm<sup>-1</sup> respectively represented the stretching vibration and bending vibration of O-H, which were resulted from the existence of H<sub>2</sub>O. In conclusion, the NMBs were successfully synthesized according to the FTIR spectra.</p>

    <p>The peak at 1705 cm<sup>-1</sup>, as shown in Figure 4, was corresponded to the stretching vibration of C=O and matched the expectation of having an intense peak near 1700 cm<sup>-1</sup> which was resulted from C=O of PAA. The peaks at 2950 and 2850 cm<sup>-1</sup> were resulted from symmetric and asymmetric saturated C-H, which matched the expectation of PE-co-PAA having two types of C-H bonds. In addition, the peak at 1465 cm<sup>-1</sup> was corresponded to the bending vibration of C-H which also matched the expectation of C-H bonds in PE-co-PAA. Lastly, peaks at 1324 and 1134 cm<sup>-1</sup> were resulted from bending vibration of O-H and stretching vibration of C-O respectively, and both of which matched the expectation since carboxylic acid was present in PAA. In conclusion, the material being examined by FTIR was definitely PE-co-PAA as it contained all the functional groups that should be measured in PE-co-PAA.</p>

    <p class="w3-xxlarge">UV-Vis spectra and standard curve of NMBs aqueous solutions</p>
    <p>As shown in <b>Figure 6</b>, as concentration of the NMBs aqueous solution increased, the absorbance tended to increase. The standard curve of concentration versus absorbance was obtained initially by calculating the intersection point of tangent lines from the start point and end point of the “shoulder”. Afterwards, six points that intersected with a perpendicular line drawn from the intersection point to the x-axis were used to draw the standard curve, as shown in <b>Figure 7</b>.</p>

    <p class="w3-xxlarge">Discussion</p>
    <p class="w3-xlarge"><b>TEM of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and PE-co-PAAB41@Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub></b></p>
    <p>TEM was utilized in order to know the actual size and shape of the magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, and due to magnetic force nanoparticles were observed as clusters. The average diameter of NMBs was obtained by calculating particles that had clear boundaries; as for the dark portions within the cluster, they were resulted from overlapping of nanoparticles and were not included in the calculation of average diameter. As for the NMBs having nonequivalent sizes, this is a consequence of inconsistent reaction conditions such as rising of solution temperature as NaOH<sub>(aq)</sub> was added or the quantitative difference between each NaOH<sub>(aq)</sub> drip.</p>

    <p class="w3-xlarge"><b>FTIR of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, PE-co-PAA and PE-co-PAAB41@Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub></b></p>

    <p>Peaks at 3422 and 1638 cm<sup>-1</sup>, as shown in <b>Figure 3</b>, indicated that water is present in the sample pellet. The solution for decreasing the peaks was to keep the surrounding area as dry as possible and to place the sample pellet in a humidity control cabinet for a longer period of time. For PE-co-PAA, as shown in <b>Figure 4</b>, four different covalent bonds were measured by the spectra with each covalent bond showing two peaks since the infrared radiation induced two kinds of vibrations from each covalent bond. </p>

    <p>FTIR of PE-co-PAAB41@Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, as shown in <b>Figure 5</b>, was expected to show combination of all intense peaks from <b>Figure 3</b> and <b>4</b>; however, as the amount of NMBs surpasses that of coated PE-co-PAAB41 shield, peaks corresponded to PE-co-PAAB41 appeared to be less intense and accurate. </p>
    <p class="w3-xlarge"><b>UV-Vis spectrophotometry of NMBs aqueous solutions</b></p>
    <p>While chemical bonds are exposed to UV light, stimulation of π-π* and n-π* results in absorbance peak in UV spectra, and based on Beer’s Law, when measure condition remains the same, absorbance is proportional to the concentration. The peak of UV-Vis spectra, as shown in <b>Figure 6</b>, wasn’t recognizable; nevertheless, by knowing the intersection point of the tangent lines from the start point and end point of the “shoulder”, we were able to create a standard curve of concentration versus absorbance at a constant wavelength.  The R<sup>2</sup> of the standard curve was close to one which indicated that NMBs suspended well in water; additionally, the reason why the extension line didn’t cross through (0,0) was that NMBs didn’t dissolve in water.</p>
    <p class="w3-xlarge"><b>Grain size analysis of NMBs aqueous solutions</b></p>
    <p>The result of grain size analysis, as shown in <b>Figure 8</b>, showed that the estimated grain size of NMBs was significantly larger than the average diameter calculated from the TEM result. Due to magnetic force, NMBs aggregated as clusters and the grain size analyzer detected the aggregated form of NMBs which led to the difference. In addition, it has been indicated that as concentration decreases the estimated grain size increases and the reason for that was molecular surface energy rises when concentration decreases, and with stronger surface energy NMBs tended to aggregate. </p>

    <p class="w3-xxlarge">Discussion</p>
    <p>As previous studies showed that GST-RHO(RGD) can specifically bind to platelet integrin αΙΙbβ3 by pull-down assay while GST-RHO(RGE) can not bind to integrin. In this project, results of pull-down and cell attachment assays of GST-RHO(RGD) were consistently to previous works. Unexpectedly, GST-RHO(RGE) behaved similarly to GST-RHO(RGD). A possible explanation is the expression clone of pGST-RHO(RGE) was contaminated with pGST-RHO(RGD). We need to verify in the future.</p>

    <p>The whole blood (5 <I>µ</I>l) from Sprague Dawley (SD) rat was loaded on the slide and used the other slide to make the smear. The red blood cells (RBCs) is around 6-8 <I>µ</I>m and the platelet is around 2-3 <I>µ</I>m which was pointed by the red line.</p>
    <p>Taking a close look, some erythrocytes appeared swell because the variation of ion concentration changed the environment constantly. The platelets were activated so the surface of platelets looked thorny.</p>

    <p>The RBC looked swelling because of the low osmotic pressure. The platelets aggregated together.</p>
    <p class="w3-xlarge"><b>Western blot analysis of integrin αΙΙb in detergent-solubilized platelets</b></p>
    <p>Four SD white rats were used in this study. We separated them in two cages and recognized them as black stain tail rat (No. 1) vs. white tail rat (No. 2), and fatty rat (No. 3) vs. thin rat (No. 4). The gradient confirmed a high specificity between integrin αΙΙb and commercial αΙΙb antibody. When the quantity of platelet declined, the western blot detection dropped down (see <b>Figure 3</b>).</p>

    <p>The intact platelets were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer first. The total protein concentration of platelets was loaded proportionally in the wells. The primary antibodies were CD41/integrin αΙΙb antibodies and were (1:1000) diluted in 1X TBST buffer. Donkey anti-rabbit IgG HRP as the secondary antibodies detected the signal of the integrin αΙΙb (125 kDa).</p>
    <p class="w3-xlarge"><b>Immunoprecipitation analysis of the integrin αΙΙb</b></p>
    <p>Magnetic beads were conjugated with 0.9 <I>µ</I>g integrin αΙΙb antibodies or 5 <I>µ</I>g IgG. The complexes of the platelets attached to magnetic beads were reacted with different total protein concentration of platelet. IgG rabbit antibodies were regarded as negative control which could not bind to the integrin αΙΙb. The primary antibodies were CD41/integrin αΙΙb antibodies in western blot analysis. Donkey anti-rabbit IgG HRP as the secondary antibodies detected the signal of the integrin αIIb. Input lane indicated the integrin αIIb molecular weight of 125 kDa, the heavy chain signal of antibodies was located at 50 kDa. The band at 125 kDa was unable to be detected if the total protein less than 0.5 <I>µ</I>g was loaded. The nano-magnetic beads were also conjugated with integrin αΙΙb and IgG antibodies. The western blot analysis procedure was the same as mentioned above. The signal at 125 kDa indicated that our nano-magnetic beads can bind to the platelet integrin αΙΙb specificity see <b>Figure 4.</b></p>

    <p>The lysed platelets with different concentration (5, 1, 0.5, 0.05 <I>µ</I>g) were pulled down by integrin αΙΙb antibodies which were respectively conjugated with (A) Mag-Beads-Protein G and nano-magnetic beads. The primary antibodies were CD41/integrin αΙΙb antibodies and were diluted (1:1000) in 1X TBST buffer. Donkey anti-rabbit IgG HRP as the secondary antibodies against the integrin αΙΙb antibodies. Input lane was positive control indicated the integrin αΙΙb molecular weight (125 kDa). IgG rabbit antibodies were regarded as negative control which could not bind the integrin αΙΙb. The heavy chain signal of antibodies was located at 50 kDa.</p>
    <p class="w3-xxlarge">Discussion</p>
    <p>We found out the platelet number vary from four rats based on <b>Table 1</b> calculation. Each rat had different number of platelets synthesis due to different life and health condition. The result of western blot in <b>Figure 3</b> indicated the small distinctive platelets integrin number in the equal total protein concentration of platelet.The commercial integrin αΙΙb antibody which could recognize the integrin sequence was highly specifically for the three dimensional integrin αΙΙb and was suitable for the purification in the immunoprecipitation based on the IP western result in <b>Figure 4</b>.</p>
